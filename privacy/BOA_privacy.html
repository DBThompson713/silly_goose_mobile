          Please note, that while the application at this stage requires permissions for the use of the camera, microphone and other features, the application does not actually utilise the camera, microphone, internet, bluetooth, or any other hardware in any way. This is a leftover due to the way the signed APK was generated and will be removed in a future build. 
        </p>

          The Book of Angel does require access to images, but only accesses the images which are packaged with the Book of Angel.
